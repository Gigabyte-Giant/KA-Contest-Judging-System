## KA-Contest-Judging-System/src
This directory holds all of the script files that need to be "compiled" with Babel.

"Compiled" scripts can be found in [`../build/scripts/`]().

### Contents
 * `./backend/` contains all of our wrappers, and any general purpose files that we re-use a lot.
 * `./client/` contains all the script files that are solely used alongside HTML files to generate our "displays".
