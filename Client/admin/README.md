# Admin Interface
## This is the admin interface for our contest admin. Much of this interface is still in progress.
* `index.html` runs the main admin interface. We name it `index.html` so one only has to visit the root of the `Client/admin` folder to reach the application.
* `new_contest.html` is used for making a new contest.
* `leaderboard.html` doesn't do anything yet, but will be used for showing a leaderboard eventually.
* `stylesheets` holds all of the CSS files for the application.
* * `stylesheets/main.css` is the main CSS file for all HTML files.
* * `stylesheets/new_contest.css` is the CSS file for `new_contest.html`.
* `scripts` holds all of the JavaScript files for the application.
* * `scripts/auth.js` is the authentication API for all HTML files.
* * `scripts/main.js` is the JavaScript file for `index.html`. It doesn't do anything right now, but will eventually.
* * `scripts/new_contest.js` is the JavaScript file for `new_contest.js`.
* * `scripts/leaderboard.js` is the JavaScript file for `leaderboard.html`.
