# Admin Interface
## This is the admin interface for our contest admin.
* `index.html` runs the main admin interface. We name it `index.html` so one only has to visit the root of the `Client/admin` folder to reach the application.
* `new_contest.html` is used for making a new contest.
* `scripts` holds all of the JavaScript files for the application.
* * `scripts/main.js` is the JavaScript file for `index.html`.
* * `scripts/auth.js` is the authentication API for all HTML files.
